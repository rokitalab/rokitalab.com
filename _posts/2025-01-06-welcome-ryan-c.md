We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Ryan Corbett as a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist in the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital (CNH) üéâ. 
Ryan joins us two years of outstanding work under the mentorship of Dr. Rokita at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). 

Ryan has played a pivotal role in advancing bioinformatics tools and applications critical for pediatric cancer research, including co-development and maintenance of the germline pathogenicity tool, [AutoGVP](https://github.com/diskin-lab-chop/AutoGVP), essential involvement in the [Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Project](https://github.com/rokitalab/OpenPedCan-Project), and development contributuions for two key CAVATICA applications, [Pathogenicity Preprocessing](https://github.com/d3b-center/D3b-Pathogenicity-Preprocessing) and [AlleleCouNT](https://github.com/d3b-center/AlleleCouNT).
Ryan's research productivity speaks for itself. 
He is lead author of a recently accepted manuscript in _NeuroOncology_, entitled, ["Genetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors from the PBTA and PNOC"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.14.24308885v2) and lead author of an upcoming preprint, _"Integrated germline and somatic profiling of pediatric CNS tumors reveals incidental findings and novel tumor biology"_. 
Ryan has collaborated on six additional manuscripts in the pediatric brain tumor field over the past two years, demonstrating his dedication to team-based science.
In addition to his research, Ryan is passionate about mentoring and teaching. He has started leading [workshops](https://github.com/rokitalab/github-workshop) for computational staff at both CHOP and CNH, exemplifying his dedication to fostering a collaborative learning environment.

We‚Äôre excited to have Ryan continue his impactful work here at CNH, contributing to our mission of advancing precision medicine for pediatric brain tumors. 
Welcome, Ryan! üëè
