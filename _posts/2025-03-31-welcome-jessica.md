We are happy to announce our recruitment of Dr. Jessica Daggett as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Children's National Hospital (CNH) üéâ. 

Jessica joins us from Syngenta Biologicals, where she led development of genomic data pipelines and visualization tools to support high-throughput genome screening in R&D. 
As a technical expert in the Crop Protection Bioinformatics Strategy Team, she created solutions for FAIR data integration and scalable genomic infrastructure.

We are excited to have Jessica join our team to further our mission of finding cures for children with pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors. 
Her experience in genome architecture, tool development, interactive dashboards, and cross-disciplinary collaboration will be a tremendous asset to the BTI.
Welcome, Jessica! üëè
