We are excited to welcome masters student, Jacob White, to the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital (CNH) 🎉.
Jacob will begin his research by studying both mechanisms of RNA splicing in pediatric brain tumors and identifying tractable splice-derived therapeutic targets.

Jacob is passionate about using multi-omics data to improve therapeutics.

Welcome, Jacob! 👏
