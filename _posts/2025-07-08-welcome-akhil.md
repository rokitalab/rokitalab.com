We are excited to welcome Akhil Chada to the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital (CNH) 🎉.
Akhil joins us as a summer student and rising high school senior at James Madison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia. 
He brings expertise in several coding languages (Python, C++, R, and Java) and advanced mathematics.

Akhil is passionate about research at the intersection of math and biology, and is especially excited to apply these skills to the biomedical world to create real impact.

We’re thrilled to have Akhil with us as we delve into predictive algorithms to target RNA splicing in pediatric brain tumors!

Welcome, Akhil! 👏
