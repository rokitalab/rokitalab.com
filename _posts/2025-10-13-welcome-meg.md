We are excited to welcome Dr. Meghali (Meg) Goswami as a Staff Scientist in the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital (CNH) 🎉.
Meg joins us from the National Cancer Institute, where she became a leading expert in tumor immunology, translational research, and biomarker discovery for immuno-oncology therapies.

At NCI, Meg designed and led independent research focused on identifying immunological correlates of clinical response and survival in patients with solid tumors treated with investigational immunotherapies in phase I/II clinical trials. Her work leveraged high-dimensional flow cytometry, multi-omic analyses, and machine learning to uncover novel mechanisms of immune modulation and predictive biomarkers of treatment response.

We’re thrilled to have you on the team, Meg, as we bring our computational discoveries to the bench, preclinically validating new therapeutic targets to advance precision medicine for children with brain tumors.
Welcome, Meg! 👏
