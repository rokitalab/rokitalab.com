We are excited to welcome Dr. Sam Chen as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Children‚Äôs National Hospital (CNH) üéâ.

Sam brings extensive experience in developing analytical workflows and integrating multi-omics datasets across industry and academic research settings. Most recently, he was a Bioinformatics Scientist at Dyno Therapeutics, where he designed and executed production-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) quality control and analytical pipelines. He also led efforts to evaluate and validate AI-designed AAV gene-therapy vectors, contributing directly to two successful product launches.

Before his time at Dyno, Sam interned at Genentech in Oncology Informatics, where he integrated multi-omic datasets to uncover transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. This work led to the development of the R package Epiregulon, which infers transcription-factor activity in single cells through gene-regulatory-network construction.


Sam is passionate about ...

We‚Äôre thrilled to have Sam on board as we continue building a robust analytical infrastructure to drive discovery and precision medicine in pediatric research here at Children's.
Welcome, Sam! üëè
