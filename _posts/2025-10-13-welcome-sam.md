We are excited to welcome Dr. Shang-Yang (Sam) Chen as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Children’s National Hospital (CNH) 🎉.

Sam brings extensive experience in developing analytical workflows and integrating multi-omics datasets across industry and academic research settings. Most recently, he was a Bioinformatics Scientist at Dyno Therapeutics, where he designed and executed production-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) quality control and analytical pipelines. He also led efforts to evaluate and validate machine guided AAV gene-therapy vectors, contributing directly to two successful product launches.

We’re thrilled to have Sam on board as we continue building a robust analytical infrastructure to drive discovery and precision medicine in pediatric research here at Children's.
Welcome, Sam! 👏
