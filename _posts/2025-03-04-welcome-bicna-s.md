We are happy to announce our recruitment of Dr. Bicna Song as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Children's National Hospital (CNH) üéâ. 

Bicna joins us after a very successful postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Wei Li at CNH, where she developed expertise in transcriptomic data analysis, including bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq, and Perturb-Seq. 
Her innovative work led to the creation of the Perturbation-Response Score (PS), a novel method to quantify how individual cells respond to genetic perturbations at single-cell resolution, providing powerful insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene function.

We are excited for Bicna to bring her expertise to the BTI Bioinformatics Core, where she will contribute to advancing precision medicine for pediatric brain tumors. 
Her deep knowledge in computational transcriptional biology and data-driven discovery will be invaluable to our mission.
Welcome, Bicna! üëè
