As a part of our splice-derived neoepitope identification research, we partnered with [Dr. Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko's](https://www.chop.edu/doctors/thomas-tikhonenko-andrei) laboratory at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in which they validated an _NRCAM_ splice event as a targetable immunotherapeutic target for pediatric high-grade gliomas. Please read more in "Neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM) variant defined by microexon skipping is an essential, antigenically distinct, and targetable proteoform in high-grade glioma" [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39868324/).
