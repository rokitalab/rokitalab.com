We are thrilled to welcome Bailey Farrow to Children’s National Hospital (CNH) as our new Senior Bioinformatics Program and Operations Manager for the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core! 🎉

Bailey brings more than a decade of experience leading complex data platforms, technical teams, and multi-institutional research initiatives across academic medicine and industry. 
Most recently, she served as Program Director for pediatric epilepsy initiatives at the University of Chicago’s Data for the Common Good, where she led large-scale, multi-institutional data-sharing initiatives spanning clinicians, researchers, patient advocacy organizations, and major philanthropic partners, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
Her work focused on building an epilepsy data commons by aligning diverse stakeholders and integrating multimodal data, including EEG, EHR, genomics, and patient-reported outcomes, into a scalable shared infrastructure. In parallel, she helped lead the development of an ethical framework for the responsible use of pediatric data in multimodal AI, operationalized through the creation of a lived-experience stakeholder engagement panel.

Prior to her work at Chicago, Bailey spent over six years at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in the Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b), where she led data operations for the NIH Common Fund’s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and the Children's Brain Tumor Network. 
This included large-scale genomic sequencing initiatives and development of cloud-based research platforms supporting tens of thousands of subjects nationwide. 
Her leadership in building data operations teams, modernizing support workflows, architecting next-generation data platforms, and managing multi-million-dollar cloud and federal grant budgets resulted in efficiency gains and long-term sustainability for complex pediatric research programs.

Bailey’s career reflects a rare combination of deep technical fluency, strategic program management, and people-centered leadership. 
She has built and led cross-functional teams across engineering, data science, quality assurance, operations, and regulatory domains—always with a focus on scalability, clarity, and impact.

We are incredibly excited to have Bailey’s expertise guiding our bioinformatics program strategy, data operations, and infrastructure development at CNH. 
Her experience scaling national research data ecosystems will be instrumental as we continue advancing precision medicine for pediatric oncology.

Welcome to the team, Bailey! 👏
