From [Dr. Yael Mosse's](https://www.research.chop.edu/people/yael-p-mosse) laboratory, we are happy to see the work of Dr. Smita Matkar, "Kinome reprogramming of G2/M kinases and repression of MYCN contribute to superior efficacy of lorlatinib in ALK-driven neuroblastoma", published today. We were happy to have played a small role in this work! Read more about it [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39907037/).
