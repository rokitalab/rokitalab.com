We were thrilled to contribute to the recently accepted manuscript, "_NRCAM_ variant defined by microexon skipping is an essential, antigenically distinct, and targetable surface proteoform in high-grade gliomas", led by the lab of collaborator Dr. Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko.
In this project, we identified a tumor-specific exon inclusion event in the _NRCAM_ gene as a new therapeutic target.
