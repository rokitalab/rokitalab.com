We were thrilled to be a part of the recent publication, "Imaging Clusters of Pediatric Low-Grade Glioma are Associated with Distinct Molecular Characteristics", led by our collaborator [Dr. Anahita Fathi Kazerooni](https://d3b.center/team-members/anahita-fathi-kazerooni/). Read more about it [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39952665/).
