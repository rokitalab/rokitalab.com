We are happy to announce our recruitment of Dr. Kaylyn Clark as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Rokita Lab and Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) at Children's National Hospital (CNH) 🎉. 

Kaylyn recently completed her Ph.D. in Genomics and Computational Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, during which she studied the genetic basis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using statistical and genetic modeling in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing polygenic risk scores (PRS).
To further study the polygenic architecture of AD, Kaylyn co-developed a joint genetic score called MetaGRS.

We are excited to have Kaylyn joining our team as we further study the germline and somatic basis of pediatric high-grade gliomas which form in patients with the tumor syndrome, Neurofibromatosis.
Welcome, Kaylyn! 👏
