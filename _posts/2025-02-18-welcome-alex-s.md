We are thrilled to welcome Alex Sickler as a Bioinformatics Engineer in the Rokita Lab and Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Children's National Hospital (CNH) üéâ. 
Alex joins us after many productive years of bioinformatics engineering and infrastructure management work at GeneDx, the National Cancer Institute, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). 

While at CHOP, Alex played a critical role in scaling modules from the [Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Project](https://github.com/rokitalab/OpenPedCan-Project) and has contributed to the development of the [Kids First single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-Seq workflows](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-dev-single-cell-rna).
Additionally, he led implementation of automated data ingest workflows and applications for the Kids First Data Resource Center.

We‚Äôre excited to have Alex join us at CNH as we build our BTI Bioinformatics Core, contributing to our mission of advancing precision medicine for pediatric brain tumors. 
Welcome, Alex! üëè
