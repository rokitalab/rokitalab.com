We are excited to welcome Dr. Chao Di as a Senior Bioinformatics Engineer and Scientist in the Rokita Lab and the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Children‚Äôs National Hospital (CNH) üéâ.

Chao brings more than a decade of experience developing computational methods and production-scale pipelines for multi-omics analysis across academic, clinical, and industry settings. 
Most recently, Chao was a Senior Computational Biology Scientist at Spark Therapeutics (Roche Group), where he developed an internal AAV vector integration analysis platform to evaluate insertion risks in gene therapy programs, optimized single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis for rare cell types, and led long-read sequencing and spatial profiling workflows.

Before his time in industry, Chao worked at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania, where he contributed to high-impact studies in immunology, cancer biology, infectious diseases, and neurodegeneration. 
His toolkit spans cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics platforms including XLIP-Seq, 4sU-Seq, ChIP-Seq, scRNA-Seq, CyTOF, and Olink ‚Äî all supported by deep experience in pipeline development with Snakemake, Nextflow, Python, R, and cloud/HPC environments.
Earlier in his career, he helped build CLIPdb and contributed to foundational ENCODE efforts on RNA-binding proteins and long non-coding RNAs.

Chao is passionate about...

We‚Äôre thrilled to have Chao on board as we continue building a robust analytical infrastructure to drive discovery and precision medicine in pediatric brain tumor research here at Children's.
Welcome, Chao! üëè
