We are excited to announce the arrival of Dr. Patricia Sullivan as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital (CNH) üéâ.
Patricia joins us from the Children's Cancer Institute in Sydney, where she became a leading expert in splice-altering variation in pediatric cancer and rare disease genomics.

Patricia brings deep expertise in splice variant interpretation, particularly in pediatric cancer and rare disease genomics.
She played a leading role in the development of multiple computational tools to improve splice variant prediction: [Introme](https://github.com/CCICB/introme) for impact prediction and [SpliceVarDB](https://compbio.ccia.org.au/splicevardb/) to mine and visualize experimentally validated human splice variants ([codebase here](https://github.com/CCICB/SpliceVarDB)). 
As a Fulbright Scholar at the Broad Institute, Patricia collaborated closely with ClinVar and ClinGen curation experts to improve the interpretation of splice-altering variants‚Äîcritical work that supports more accurate pathogenicity classifications in clinical genomics and precision medicine.
In addition to her research accomplishments, Patricia is passionate about...

We‚Äôre thrilled to have Patricia join our team as we continue to build tools and uncover biological insights that advance precision medicine for children with brain tumors.
Welcome, Patricia! üëè
