<p>Kaylyn recently completed her Ph.D. in Genomics and Computational Biology from the University of Pennsylvania, during which she studied the genetic basis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD) using statistical and genetic modeling in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) utilizing polygenic risk scores (PRS).
To further study the polygenic architecture of AD, Kaylyn co-developed a joint genetic score called MetaGRS.</p>

<p>We are excited to have Kaylyn joining our team as we further study the germline and somatic basis of pediatric high-grade gliomas which form in patients with the tumor syndrome, Neurofibromatosis.
Welcome, Kaylyn! üëè</p>]]></content><author><name>Jo Lynne Rokita</name></author><category term="team" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce our recruitment of Dr. Kaylyn Clark as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Rokita Lab and Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) at Children‚Äôs National Hospital (CNH) üéâ.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Dr. Bicna Song joins the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core!</title><link href="/preview/pr-40/2025/03/04/welcome-bicna-s.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Dr. Bicna Song joins the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core!" /><published>2025-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-18T17:05:45+00:00</updated><id>/preview/pr-40/2025/03/04/welcome-bicna-s</id><content type="html" xml:base="/preview/pr-40/2025/03/04/welcome-bicna-s.html"><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce our recruitment of Dr. Bicna Song as a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Children‚Äôs National Hospital (CNH) üéâ.</p>

<p>Bicna joins us after a very successful postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Wei Li at CNH, where she developed expertise in transcriptomic data analysis, including bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq, and Perturb-Seq. 
Her innovative work led to the creation of the Perturbation-Response Score (PS), a novel method to quantify how individual cells respond to genetic perturbations at single-cell resolution, providing powerful insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene function.</p>

<p>We are excited for Bicna to bring her expertise to the BTI Bioinformatics Core, where she will contribute to advancing precision medicine for pediatric brain tumors. 
Her deep knowledge in computational transcriptional biology and data-driven discovery will be invaluable to our mission.
