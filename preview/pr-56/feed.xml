<p>Chao brings more than a decade of experience developing computational methods and production-scale pipelines for multi-omics analysis across academic, clinical, and industry settings. 
Most recently, Chao was a Senior Computational Biology Scientist at Spark Therapeutics (Roche Group), where he developed an internal AAV vector integration analysis platform to evaluate insertion risks in gene therapy programs, optimized single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis for rare cell types, and led long-read sequencing and spatial profiling workflows.</p>

<p>Before his time in industry, Chao worked at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania, where he contributed to high-impact studies in immunology, cancer biology, infectious diseases, and neurodegeneration. 
His toolkit spans cutting-edge transcriptomics and proteomics platforms including XLIP-Seq, 4sU-Seq, ChIP-Seq, scRNA-Seq, CyTOF, and Olink ‚Äî all supported by deep experience in pipeline development with Snakemake, Nextflow, Python, R, and cloud/HPC environments.
Earlier in his career, he helped build CLIPdb and contributed to foundational ENCODE efforts on RNA-binding proteins and long non-coding RNAs.</p>

<p>Chao is passionate about applying data science and engineering to tackle big data challenges in biomedical research. He thrives at the intersection of biology and computation, building scalable pipelines and analytical frameworks to extract insights from single-cell, spatial, and multi-omics datasets. At CNH, he‚Äôs excited to collaborate across teams to transform complex data into actionable discoveries for pediatric care.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre thrilled to have Chao on board as we continue building a robust analytical infrastructure to drive discovery and precision medicine in pediatric brain tumor research here at Children‚Äôs.

Patricia joins us from the Children‚Äôs Cancer Institute in Sydney, where she became a leading expert in splice-altering variation in pediatric cancer and rare disease genomics.</p>

<p>Patricia brings deep expertise in splice variant interpretation.
She played a leading role in the development of multiple computational tools to improve splice variant prediction: <a href="https://github.com/CCICB/introme">Introme</a> for impact prediction and <a href="https://compbio.ccia.org.au/splicevardb/">SpliceVarDB</a> to mine and visualize experimentally validated human splice variants (<a href="https://github.com/CCICB/SpliceVarDB">codebase here</a>). 
As a Fulbright Scholar at the Broad Institute, Patricia collaborated closely with variant curation experts from the Rare Genomes Project and ClinGen to improve the interpretation of splice-altering variants‚Äîcritical work that supports more accurate pathogenicity classifications in clinical genomics and precision medicine.</p>

<p>Patricia is passionate about using genetic data to close diagnostic gaps and help more people access precision therapies. She is especially interested in complex or atypical genetic variation, with the goal of ensuring that individuals who are often missed by standard testing can receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate care.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre thrilled to have Patricia join our team as we continue to build tools and uncover biological insights that advance precision medicine for children with brain tumors.
