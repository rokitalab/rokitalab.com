Ryan joins us after two years of outstanding work under the mentorship of Dr. Rokita at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).</p>

<p>Ryan has played a pivotal role in advancing bioinformatics tools and applications critical for pediatric cancer research, including co-development and maintenance of the germline pathogenicity tool, <a href="https://github.com/diskin-lab-chop/AutoGVP">AutoGVP</a>, essential involvement in the <a href="https://github.com/rokitalab/OpenPedCan-Project">Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) Project</a>, and development contributions for two key CAVATICA applications, <a href="https://github.com/d3b-center/D3b-Pathogenicity-Preprocessing">Pathogenicity Preprocessing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/d3b-center/AlleleCouNT">AlleleCouNT</a>.
Ryan‚Äôs research productivity speaks for itself. 
He is lead author of a recently accepted manuscript in <em>NeuroOncology</em>, entitled, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.14.24308885v2">‚ÄúGenetic ancestry superpopulations show distinct prevalence and outcomes across pediatric central nervous system tumors from the PBTA and PNOC‚Äù</a> and lead author of an upcoming preprint, <em>‚ÄúIntegrated germline and somatic profiling of pediatric CNS tumors reveals incidental findings and novel tumor biology‚Äù</em>. 
Ryan has collaborated on six additional manuscripts in the pediatric brain tumor field over the past two years, demonstrating his dedication to team-based science.
In addition to his research, Ryan is passionate about mentoring and teaching. He has started leading <a href="https://github.com/rokitalab/github-workshop">workshops</a> for computational staff at both CHOP and CNH, exemplifying his dedication to fostering a collaborative learning environment.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre excited to have Ryan continue his impactful work here at CNH, contributing to our mission of advancing precision medicine for pediatric brain tumors.
