<p>Bailey brings more than a decade of experience leading complex data platforms, technical teams, and multi-institutional research initiatives across academic medicine and industry. 
Most recently, she served as Program Director for pediatric epilepsy initiatives at the University of Chicago’s Data for the Common Good, where she led large-scale, multi-institutional data-sharing initiatives spanning clinicians, researchers, patient advocacy organizations, and major philanthropic partners, including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
Her work focused on building an epilepsy data commons by aligning diverse stakeholders and integrating multimodal data, including EEG, EHR, genomics, and patient-reported outcomes, into a scalable shared infrastructure. In parallel, she helped lead the development of an ethical framework for the responsible use of pediatric data in multimodal AI, operationalized through the creation of a lived-experience stakeholder engagement panel.</p>

<p>Prior to her work at Chicago, Bailey spent over six years at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in the Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b), where she led data operations for the NIH Common Fund’s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program and the Children’s Brain Tumor Network. 
This included large-scale genomic sequencing initiatives and development of cloud-based research platforms supporting tens of thousands of subjects nationwide. 
Her leadership in building data operations teams, modernizing support workflows, architecting next-generation data platforms, and managing multi-million-dollar cloud and federal grant budgets resulted in efficiency gains and long-term sustainability for complex pediatric research programs.</p>

<p>Bailey’s career reflects a rare combination of deep technical fluency, strategic program management, and people-centered leadership. 
She has built and led cross-functional teams across engineering, data science, quality assurance, operations, and regulatory domains—always with a focus on scalability, clarity, and impact.</p>

<p>We are incredibly excited to have Bailey’s expertise guiding our bioinformatics program strategy, data operations, and infrastructure development at CNH. 
Her experience scaling national research data ecosystems will be instrumental as we continue advancing precision medicine for pediatric oncology.</p>

Led by <a href="https://rokitalab.com/members/02-ryan-corbett.html">Dr. Ryan Corbett</a> in the Rokita Lab, this work represents a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of germline and somatic data from 830 pediatric brain tumor patients in the #PBTA — truly a <em>tour de force</em> by the team.</p>

<p>We highlight the importance of germline testing at diagnosis, identifying rare germline pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 48 patients (5.7%) who had no clinically reported cancer predisposition syndrome. 
Among all P/LP carriers, 34.6% had putative somatic second hits or loss-of-function tumor alterations, consistent with classical tumor suppressor models.
We link germline P/LP variation with somatic events, tumor histologies, molecular subtypes, and clinical outcomes — with some variants associated with protection and others with poorer survival.
Together, these findings deepen our understanding of how inherited or early-life genetic changes shape pediatric CNS tumor development, behavior, and outcomes. 
They pave the way for improved diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring, and targeted therapy.</p>

<p>🙏 Enormous thanks to our collaborators Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia — especially my partner-in-crime Sharon Diskin and co-first author Rebecca Kaufman. 
Thank you to our clinical experts whose insights into gene lists and variant curation were invaluable: Miriam Bornhorst, Suzanne MacFarland, Kristina Cole, and Shelly McQuaid.</p>

<p>Special thanks to the patients and families, the Children’s Brain Tumor Network for creating this dataset, the anonymous donors to the Brain Tumor Institute, Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center for supporting us with cloud credits, and every member of the team whose dedication made this possible.</p>
