Dr. Jessica Daggett is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH). 

Before joining the BTI, Dr. Daggett was a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at Syngenta Biologicals where she led development of genomic analysis tools and data pipelines to support high-throughput screening and discovery in agricultural R&D. 
She also served as a technical advisor to the Crop Protection Bioinformatics Strategy Team, supporting FAIR data integration and genomic data infrastructure.

During her Ph.D., Dr. Daggett completed multiple telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies of the extremophile _Galdieria sulphuraria_, and developed custom bioinformatics pipelines for downstream analysis. 
She is particularly interested in using graph-based approaches and genome-scale analytics to support discovery across diverse biological systems.
