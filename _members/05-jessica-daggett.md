Dr. Jessica Daggett is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH). 

Before joining the BTI, Dr. Daggett was a Senior Genomics Scientist at Syngenta where she led development of genomic analysis tools and data pipelines to support high-throughput microbial screening and discovery in agricultural R&D. 
She also served as a technical advisor to the Crop Protection Bioinformatics Strategy Team, supporting FAIR data integration and genomic data infrastructure.

During her Ph.D., Dr. Daggett completed multiple telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies of the extremophile _Galdieria sulphuraria_, and developed custom bioinformatics pipelines for downstream analysis. 
She is particularly interested in using graph-based approaches and genome-scale analytics to support discovery across diverse biological systems.

Dr. Daggett is passionate about effective use of biological data to increase organizational efficiency and improve outcomes.

Dr. Daggett completed her M.Sci. at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/) and Ph.D.  at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom. 
Outside of the lab, Jessica enjoys hiking, rugby, and spending time with family.
