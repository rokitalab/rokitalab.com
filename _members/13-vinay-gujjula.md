Harivinay (Vinay) Gujjula is a Master of Science student in the [Bioinformatics and Molecular Biochemistry](https://biochemistry.smhs.gwu.edu/ms-bioinformatics-and-molecular-biochemistry) program at the George Washington University.
Vinay joined the Rokita Lab in the Spring of 2026 and is excited to delve into developing skills to be a bioinformatician.
He has a background in wet lab techniques and hopes that this dual training will better enable him to gain a fuller understanding of biology of pediatric brain tumors.
Prior to GWU, he studied the functional evolution of proteins with MD simulations and experimental techniques like site-directed muatgenesis and luciferase assays while he completed his B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). In addition, he worked in the Molecular department at EPL Bioanalytics, a GLP laboratory.

Vinay is passionate about exploring how genetic ancestry may influence tumor development. In his free time, he enjoys cooking and experimenting with new recipes, and when the weather permits, he loves engaging in outdoor activities.
