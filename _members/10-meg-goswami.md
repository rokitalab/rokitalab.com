Dr. Meghali Goswami is a Staff Scientist in the Rokita Lab, housed within the [Rood Lab](https://lnkd.in/erWqs5zN) at Children's National Hospital (CNH). 

Prior to starting at CNH, Dr. Goswami worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as well as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

Dr. Goswamiâ€™s prior research at the NCI investigated immunological mechanisms driving clinical responses to investigational immunotherapies in advanced solid tumors. 
She led studies on how tumor-targeting immunocytokines and checkpoint inhibitors shape T cell function and memory, integrating high-dimensional flow cytometry, multi-omic analyses, and machine learning to identify predictive biomarkers and guide novel immunotherapy development.

Dr. Goswami is passionate about integrating immunology, genomics, and data-driven discovery to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. She is also committed to building welcoming and inclusive communities that foster growth, collaborations, and friendships.

Dr. Goswami completed her B.S. at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) and Ph.D. in Molecular Medicine at the [George Washington University](https://gwu.edu). 
Outside of the lab, Meg enjoys spending time with her family, hosting dinner parties, and fostering dogs.
