Dr. Ryan Corbett is a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist in the Rokita Lab at Children’s National Hospital (CNH). 

Before starting at CNH, Dr. Corbett worked as a bioinformatics scientist at [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/) at the Center for [Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b)](https://d3b.center/) (2022-2023) and the [Diskin Laboratory]( https://diskinlab.org) (2023-2024).

Dr. Corbett’s research utilizes multimodal pediatric cancer data sets to advance understanding of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumor biology. He currently leads efforts to integrate germline sequencing and somatic molecular profiling to elucidate novel genetic risk factors and biological mechanisms underlying CNS tumorigenesis. He also contributes to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives by assessing contributions of genetic ancestry and social determinants of health (SDoH) to pediatric CNS tumor development and clinical outcomes. 

Dr. Corbett is passionate about contributing to analysis tools that facilitate pediatric CNS cancer research. He currently manages the Automated Germline Variant Pathogenicity ([AutoGVP]( https://github.com/diskin-lab-chop/AutoGVP)) tool, which rapidly classifies germline variant pathogenicity using the most up-to-date ACMG criteria. 

Dr. Corbett completed his B.S. and B.A. at [the University of Rhode Island](https://www.uri.edu), and Ph.D. in [genetics and genome sciences at Michigan State University](https://ggs.natsci.msu.edu). Outside of the lab, Ryan enjoys traveling, pottery, and spending time with his dog, Kennedy.
