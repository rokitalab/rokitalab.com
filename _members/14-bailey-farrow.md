Bailey Farrow is the Senior Bioinformatics Program and Operations Manager for the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Children’s National Hospital (CNH).

Before joining CNH, Bailey served as Program Director for pediatric epilepsy initiatives at the University of Chicago’s Data for the Common Good, where she led multi-institutional data-sharing initiatives to build a pediatric rare epilepsy data commons integrating EEG, EHR, genomics, and patient-reported outcomes into a scalable shared infrastructure under a common governance structure. She also helped lead the development of an ethical framework for the responsible use of pediatric data in multimodal AI algorithm development, including the creation of a lived-experience stakeholder engagement panel to embed patient and family perspectives into governance.

Prior to her work at the University of Chicago, Bailey spent over six years at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine. 
As Associate Technology Director, she led large-scale genomic and clinical data operations for the Children's Brain Tumor Network and NIH Common Fund’s Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, encompassing thousands of subjects and petabytes of genomic data. 
She partnered closely with clinicians, scientists, engineers, and federal stakeholders to translate complex research requirements into scalable, secure, and sustainable data infrastructure and operational strategy.

Bailey’s expertise spans strategic planning, data governance, technical program management, financial and grant management, platform architecture, operations and cross-functional team leadership. 
She is passionate about building ethical, patient-centered data ecosystems that accelerate discovery while fostering collaboration, transparency, and long-term sustainability in biomedical research. She especially enjoys building teams and workflows that bring clarity to complex work, maximize resources, and foster a collaborative, high-trust team culture.

Bailey completed her B.S. in Mathematical and Computer Sciences from the [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/). 
Outside of the lab, Bailey enjoys testing new recipes, building surprisingly elaborate Airtable bases for everyday life, experimenting with creative photography, and tending to her small but enthusiastic home zoo.
