Akhil Chada is a rising senior at James Madison High School in Fairfax County, Virginia, performing computational research at the intersection of RNA splicing and peptide binding prediction in the Rokita Lab this summer.

Akhil has previously conducted research in Bayesian statistics at Georgetown University, where he applied Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations on patient data for phase II clinical trials. He has also been working at Northeastern University to optimize a Brownian dynamics program to study amino acid behaviour over large pH ranges. Recently, he has pursued independent research where he is applying topological data analysis and machine learning methods to DTI brain data of maltreated children.

Akhil is passionate about research at the intersection of math and biology.

Outside of the lab, Akhil enjoys spending time with family/friends, playing basketball, and fostering community impact.
