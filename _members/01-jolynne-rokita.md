Dr. Jo Lynne Rokita is Principal Investigator (PI) of the Rokita Lab and Director of the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core Facility within the [Center of Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR)](https://research.childrensnational.org/center-for-cancer-and-immunology) at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH). She is a Tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Pediatrics](https://pediatrics.smhs.gwu.edu/) at the George Washington University [School of Medicine and Health Sciences](https://smhs.gwu.edu/).

Before opening the Rokita Lab at CNH, Dr. Rokita led the Bioinformatics Translational Pediatric Oncology Team at the Center for [Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b)](https://d3b.center/) at [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/), a team of multidisciplinary bioinformatics scientists who advance pediatric oncology research and precision medicine through cross-functional team collaboration and development of open-source analytical tools, frameworks, and data resources. 

Dr. Rokita joined CHOP in 2015 and prior to joining D3b, she led integrative genomics research in the Maris Laboratory focused on [genomic characterization of pediatric PDX models](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31693904/), defining the sub-clonal landscape of high-risk neuroblastoma, and elucidating epigenomic mechanisms of transcriptional repression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. 
Prior to joining CHOP, Dr. Rokita led the development and validation of clinical genetics reference materials for CMV, BK, and JC viruses at the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/).

Dr. Rokita completed her B.S. at [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) (We are!), M.S. at [Arcadia University](https://www.arcadia.edu/), and Ph.D. in [pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University](https://pharmtox.vcu.edu/). 
She is passionate about, and committed to, using genomics to improve survival and quality of life for children with brain tumors.
