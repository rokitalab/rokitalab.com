Dr. Chao Di is a Senior Bioinformatics Engineer and Scientist in the Rokita Lab and the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH).

Before starting at CNH, Dr. Di most recently worked as a Senior Computational Biology Scientist at Spark Therapeutics (Roche Group) where he developed and automated multiple production-scale pipelines.
He developed an AAV vector integration analysis platform to enable the evaluation of insertion risks in gene therapy programs, optimized single-nucleus RNA-seq data analysis for profiling of rare cell types as well as target discovery, managed a spatial profiling workflow, and developed long-read sequencing pipelines for PacBio using Snakemake and Nextflow.
Prior to his work at Spark, Dr. Di spent several years at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania developing bioinformatics workflows and insights for cancer, neurodegenerative, and infectious diseases using a wide array of specialized multi-omic data (XLIP-Seq, metagenomics, 4sU-Seq, EU-Seq, ChIP-Seq, scRNA-Seq, CyTOF, and Olink proteomics, to name a few).
