Dr. Sam Chen is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH) broadly supporting investigators within the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR) at Children's National.

Before starting at CNH, Dr. Chen worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist at Dyno Therapeutics where he designed and executed production scale single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) QC and analytical workflows. 
There, he also spearheaded the evaluation and validation of AI-designed AAV  gene therapy vectors, contributing to product launches and licensing agreements.

Prior to his work at Dyno, Dr. Chen interned at Genentech, where he contributed to the development of [Epiregulon](https://github.com/xiaosaiyao/epiregulon), an R package to infer transcription factor (TF) activity in single cells through integrative modelling of multi-omics data.

Dr. Chen completed his Ph.D. in Biomedical Informatics at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). His dissertation research focused on multi-omics analyses (scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, CITE-seq, ATAC-seq) to characterize
macrophage heterogeneity and inflammatory pathways in rheumatoid arthritis and liver cholestasis.

Dr. Chen is passionate about applying single-cell and multi-omics approaches to advance precision diagnostics and therapies for pediatric cancer and immune diseases. Outside of the lab, Sam enjoys traveling, watching baseball, and searching for good food.
