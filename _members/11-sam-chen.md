Dr. Sam Chen is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH) broadly supporting investigators within the Center for Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR) at Children's National.

Before starting at CNH, Dr. Chen worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist at Dyno Therapeutics where he designed and executed production scale single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) QC and analytical workflows. 
There, he also spearheaded the evaluation and validation of AI-designed AAV  gene therapy vectors, contributing to two product launches.

Prior to his work at Dyno, Dr. Chen interned at Genentech in Oncology Informatics where he integrated multiomic datasets to interrogate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. 
This work resulted in development of the R package, [Epiregulon](https://github.com/xiaosaiyao/epiregulon), to infer transcription factor (TF) activity in single cells through gene regulatory network construction.

Dr. Chen's dissertation research focused on multi-omics analyses (scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, CITE-seq, ATAC-seq) to characterize
immune cell heterogeneity and inflammatory pathways in rheumatoid arthritis and liver cholestasis.
