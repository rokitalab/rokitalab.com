Dr. Patricia Sullivan is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Rokita Lab at Children’s National Hospital (CNH). 

During her Ph.D., Dr. Sullivan performed extensive research and became an expert on splice-altering variants with a focus on pediatric cancers.
She advanced the computational tool, Introme, a tool to predict the impact of DNA variants on RNA splicing, and led the development of SpliceVarDB, an interactive database of experimentally-validated human splice variants.
As a prestigious Fullbright Scholarship at the Broad Institute, Dr. Sullivan collaborated with leading variant curation teams to improve the interpretation of splice-altering variants within ClinVar and ClinGen, contributing to more accurate pathogenicity assignments in clinical genomics.
