Dr. Bicna Song is a Bioinformatics Scientist in the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) Bioinformatics Core at Childrenâ€™s National Hospital (CNH). 

Before joining the BTI, Dr. Song completed her postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Wei Li at CNH.

Dr. Song has pioneered the development of the _Perturbation-Response Score (PS)_ used to analyze single-cell gene perturbation responses. Her expertise spans machine learning for drug sensitivity prediction, CRISPR/Cas9 functional genomics, and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, with applications in cancer biology, immunotherapy, and developmental biology. Through many collaborations with leading research groups, she has contributed to understanding lineage regulators in pancreatic development, tumor suppressor mechanisms in neurofibromatosis, and drug synergy for latent HIV-1, culminating in multiple high-impact publications.
