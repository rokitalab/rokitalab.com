# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Rokita Lab Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Rokita Lab! 
Our mission is to advance knowledge through innovative research and tool development while fostering a collaborative, inclusive, and respectful environment. 
We are committed to using and contributing to open-source tools, promoting equitable collaboration, and supporting all lab members in achieving their fullest potential. 
This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values and standards.

### 1. **Commitment to Open Science**

We believe in the power of open-source code, tools, platforms, and data sharing to enhance scientific discovery. 
We document all computational aspects of the scientific process.
To support this philosophy, our lab:
   - Ensures reproducibility by sharing code, data, and methods wherever possible.
   - Respects licensing and usage requirements of external software and datasets.

### 2. **Collaborative Research Environment**

Our lab thrives on teamwork and the open exchange of ideas. 
To support a productive and innovative lab culture, we value:
   - **Transparent communication**: we share ideas, progress, and challenges openly.
   - **Constructive feedback**: we offer and receive feedback graciously, with the shared goal of advancing everyoneâ€™s work.
   - **Documentation**: we follow structured repository guidelines coupled with documentation to make our code and methods understandable for lab members, collaborators, and future users.
   - **Open Code Review**: we engage in routine, open scientific and structural review of code through a pull request model to ensure the highest rigor for analyses, optimization of code, and reproducibility for any future code or tool users.

### 3. **Inclusivity and Diversity**

We are committed to creating a lab environment that is welcoming to people of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences. 
Every lab member should:
   - Value diversity of thought and respect differences in perspective and experience.
   - Use inclusive language in all communications.
   - Support each other in personal and professional growth, recognizing that inclusion strengthens our research and community.

### 4. **Respect and Professionalism**

Respect is fundamental to a positive and productive lab culture. 
All members are expected to:
   - Treat one another with kindness and respect, through both in-person and online interactions.
   - Avoid harassment, discrimination, and any behavior that undermines the safety and comfort of lab members.
   - Respect the contributions and time of others; be punctual, reliable, and considerate with deadlines and shared resources.

### 5. **Conflict Resolution**

Disagreements and conflicts may arise, and we are committed to resolving them constructively:
   - Address conflicts early and directly, focusing on the issue and not the person.
   - If necessary, seek mediation or support from Dr. Rokita or other hospital/university resources.
   - Maintain professionalism, even during challenging discussions.

### 6. **Ethical Use of Data and Resources**

Scientific integrity is central to our work. 
All lab members should:
   - Use lab and computational resources responsibly and in alignment with hospital/university policies.
   - Maintain the confidentiality and privacy of sensitive data.
   - Avoid plagiarism and give proper credit for others' work.

### Reporting Concerns

We strive to make our lab a safe and supportive space for all. 
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please reach out to Dr. Rokita. Confidentiality and support are assured.

By adhering to these principles, we ensure that our lab remains a place where everyone can contribute meaningfully and feel valued. 
Thank you for helping us build a collaborative and respectful lab community!
