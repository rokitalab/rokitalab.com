We are thrilled to announce the opening of the Rokita Lab at Children's National Hospital within the Brain Tumor Institute (BTI) and Center for Cancer and Immunology Research (CCIR)! Situated within a leading pediatric institution, our lab is equipped with cutting-edge technology and resources, fostering a collaborative environment for groundbreaking discoveries. We are also a part of the Department of Pediatrics within the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. Weâ€™re excited to accelerate our research and expand our efforts to improve outcomes for children with brain cancer.
